Well, this is it. The CorkScrew Mod 2.16, the source. It's all there (I hope). Good luck trying to figure out what the hell I did, because even I am confused. Most of the stuff I changes is not marked, and comments are scarce. I do hope that y'all can figure out the things you would like to code for yourself, like the grapple.

Good luck and have fun!
